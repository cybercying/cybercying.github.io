# Espresso 101: Understanding Coffee Types

Before we dive deeper into espresso, let's briefly touch upon the vast world of coffee itself. You might be surprised to learn there are many ways to make coffee, and each method brings out different qualities from the beans.

## Coffee vs. Espresso: A Brewing Difference

First, it's important to clarify: **coffee** refers to the beverage made from roasted coffee beans. **Espresso** is a *type* of coffee that is brewed in a very specific way. All espresso is coffee, but not all coffee is espresso!

Here are a few common ways coffee is brewed:

### 1. Drip Coffee (Your Everyday Brew)
* **How it's made:** Hot water drips through ground coffee held in a filter.
* **Characteristics:** Often brewed in larger batches, resulting in a lighter body and less intense flavor compared to espresso. This is what most people think of as "a cup of coffee."

### 2. Pour-Over (Crafted & Clean)
* **How it's made:** Hot water is slowly and precisely poured over coffee grounds in a cone-shaped filter, allowing for controlled extraction.
* **Characteristics:** Known for a clean, bright, and nuanced flavor profile, often highlighting the delicate notes of the coffee beans.

### 3. French Press (Bold & Full-Bodied)
* **How it's made:** Coarsely ground coffee is steeped in hot water, then separated by pressing down a plunger with a mesh filter.
* **Characteristics:** Produces a rich, full-bodied coffee with more sediment, leading to a bolder and sometimes slightly grittier texture.

### 4. Espresso (Concentrated & Intense)
* **How it's made:** As we mentioned, it's made by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely-ground coffee.
* **Characteristics:** Highly concentrated, intense flavor, thick body, and topped with crema. It's the base for a whole menu of drinks!

Now that you have a better idea of how espresso fits into the broader coffee landscape, let's look at the key elements that make up an espresso shot.
